Using the TomTom API, we generated realistic data for 150 commuters, including random latitude and longitude pairs and estimated travel times (ETT), totaling 2,065 records. The data was used to create databases and train a machine learning model using the Haversine formula, simulating traffic, and integrating with a user-friendly front-end.
